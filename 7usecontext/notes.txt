case 1 : without context if want to access something which is presente at the app.jsx into the components folder file like navbar.jsx , button.jsx,component1.jsx

to achive this we follow the following structure 

  app
    navbar 
       button
          component1

to follow this approch you can reffer the non-context folder


case 2 : with context if want to access something which is presente at the app.jsx into the components folder file like navbar , button,component1 so for that we use context api to share the data between the components and the app.jsx file whos name is useContext

for more reffer the main code
